<p>My name is Soroush Hashemi Far and I'm a <b>software engineering student at Razi university</b> of Kermanshah/Iran. 
  Lately started to working on <b>Machine Learning</b> algorithms and, in particular, <b>Deep Learning</b> using basically 
  <b>Python</b> programming language. One of my hubbies is trying to understand complex things(exactly what ML algorithms are!) 
  and every single day I'm trying to learn new things(by myself, a <b>self-learner</b>). With no doubt AI can make our lives 
  easier and I think robots equipped with AI can be our best friends and can tell us things we have no idea about them! <strong>
