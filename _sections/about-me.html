  I'm studying <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> at Razi University (Iran, Kermanshah). 
  I'm interested in many computer science aspects, but honestly, I'm crazy about <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>Deep Learning</strong> fields and 
  always try to sharpen my skills through working on tiny personal projects.
</p>

<p align="left">
  I'm fueled by my passion for understanding how to use ML and DL in daily life and strongly encourage people to enter this field. 
  I'm also eager on building on my academic foundations in computer engineering and stay in tune with the latest machine learning 
  strategies through online courses.

  Nowadays, I'm looking for a challenging, fast-paced environment within A.I. to utilise my written knowledge and develop my creative skill set further.
