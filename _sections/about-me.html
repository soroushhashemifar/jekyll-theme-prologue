  I'm studying <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> at Razi University (Iran/Kermanshah). 
  My research topics are <strong>Machine Learning and Deep Learning</strong> fields and 
  trying to improve my <strong>Python programming language</strong> skills all the time.
</p>

<p align="left">
  I'm fueled by my passion for understanding how to use ML and DL in daily life and strongly encourage people to enter these fields
  . I consider myself a <strong>"forever student"</strong>. I'm also eager to both build on my academic foundations in computer 
  engineering and stay in tune with the latest machine learning strategies through continued online courses.

  Currently, I'm looking for international universities to apply for master and for opportunities to research in ML and DL fields.
